The setting files in the ProjectSettings.zip are ONLY TO BE USED IN A BLANK NEW PROJECT!

-- or in the case of import errors, such as tags not being carried over properly -

Do not import these into an existing project, as it will overwrite your project's settings!!!

** We are not responsible for overwritten project files **

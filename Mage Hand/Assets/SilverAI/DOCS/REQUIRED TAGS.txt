** The AI Engine requires the following tags:

- BulletIgnore
- Projectile
- HidingPlace


** The Demo Scenes require the following tags:

- Team1
- Team2
- Team3
- Team4

There is currently no way for us to include the tags WITH the Unity Package export.
So when you run the demo scenes, the AI will throw errors about tags.
Please add these tags to your project first.

Additionally, we included the ProjectSettings file, in the /DOCS/ folder
that includes the correct tag settings. You may replace the TagManager
setting with the ones found in the DOCS folder, BUT only do this
to a new blank project or you will overwrite existing project settings!

PLEASE READ THE PDF FILE IN THIS FOLDER!
"Upcoming changes - Important Announcement.pdf"


*** VERSION 1.1.7 ***

1) Fully updated to Unity 5.3+
2) Minor changes: Updated script API to comply with 5.3+
3) Cleaned some unused files.


-------------------------------
PREVIOUS VERSIONS
-------------------------------

*** VERSION 1.1.6 ***
1) Removed unused animation files that were causing some editors to crash on start.


*** VERSION 1.1.5 ***

1) UPDATES TO Brain_Standard Combat AI : 
a) Added setting: Crouch When Hit.  Originally, the AI will automatically crouch
low when it's getting shot at, but there was no way for you, the developer, to turn it off. Now, we provide
the option to turn off auto-crouching on hit.  So check this if you want the AI to "duck" down low when its getting
shot at, and uncheck if you want otherwise.
b) Added setting: Random Move When Hit.  Lets the AI move in random directions when it's being shot at. This is an attempt to
get out of his assailant's gun sights.
c) Added setting: Random Turn When Hit.  If (b) is unchecked, and this setting is checked, then the AI will 
randomly turn in a direction when being shot at.  This is an attempt to figure out where his shooter is.


2) Updated Movement Motor module --> There are 2 new slots at bottom for debug use. This includes
Target Destination and Distance to Destination.  Both are meant to be watched in the Editor during play-testing
with live stats.

3) Updated Awareness module --> There are 3 new slots for debug use. This includes Nearest Target,
Current Target, and Distance to Target.  These are meant to be monitored in real time, during testing.
They are READ-ONLY. You may also read them from external scripts: GameObject nearestTarget,
GameObject currentTarget, float distanceToTarget

4) Fixed minor bug in module Death Effects Basic --> It now plays the custom Death trigger animation that you pick.
Originally, it only plays an animation trigger named "Death"

5) Updated core Silver engine (SilverAI.Core. dll) -- C# integration syntax remains unchanged.

6) Removed potential element (Lightmaps) that was causing the Unity editor to crash for some users.
So now, the demo scenes look slightly different from before because lightmaps have been removed.

7) Updated NavMesh Agent on sample AI prefabs to have higher Stopping Distance.  Previously, a smaller stopping distance
resulted in some AI's walking into each other in scenes with lots of AI.

8) Updated ERRORS.txt to reflect some errors that might arise on initial import and how to resolve them.


_____________________________________________________________

*** VERSION 1.1 ***
1) Added experimental ragdoll support 
	- in the Basic Death Effects component, enable "Use Ragdoll"
	- this will override the death animations and will use procedural, physics-driven death effects instead
	- note: your model must have a ragdoll created on it first. use the Unity ragdoll creator.
	- your ragdoll must be strong enough to widthstand projectile force speeds of 1200 or more,
	- or else the ragdoll will go flying across the sky on death.

2) Further optimized the Object Pooling system (now much smaller in memory)

3) Added a UI Health component to the Third Person shooter game
4) Updated Third Person shooter demo scene
5) Fixed minor bugs / quirks in some demo scenes

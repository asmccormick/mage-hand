Thanks for purchasing our products!

This package is the main required "base" to run the Silver AI system. 
Due to its low price, the advanced features must be purchased separately (only buy what you need!)

This base package already contains most features you need to rapidly add combat AI without coding, including:

- One-Click Add A.I. (see documentation)
- Melee / Ranged Attacks
- Health / Armor system
- Basic Patrol / Wander
- Advanced line of sight
- Unlimited teams and targets
- Advanced Cover System
- Sample source code
- 3rd Person Shooter Minigame (full source to 3rd person controller!)
- UFPS Minigame (UFPS not included)
- and more!

But if you want more advanced features, we have several extensions available:

*** Advanced Tactical Behaviors ***
Adds several new abilities such as advanced flanking, escape maneuvers, run away when low HP, call for backup
and more!


*** Advanced Movement System ***
Replaces current movement component with new features: "Burst-move" ability (AI initially moves with a very
fast burst of speed),  movement points (AI will become tired after a while and stop moving to recharge), and more!


*** Advanced Attack System ***
Replaces current attack component with new features: Grenade AI, melee attacks now have unlimited random animations,
unlimited on-hit effects, unlimited melee audio tracks.
Ranged attacks now have burst-fire mode, inaccuracy modification, multiple bullet-spawn positions (like shotgun)
and more!


*** Advanced Stealth AI ***
(this extension is under development!)

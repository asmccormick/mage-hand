** UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS **

If you are upgrading a previous version of SILVER AI, you need to do the following:

1) First, import the NEW package into a blank project so you don't accidentally overwrite something.

2) Read the TXT file, "UPDATE LOG" to see what was updated. Most likely the update concerns only the core engine DLL files.

3) Copy the folder: Assets / SILVER AI System / SILVER CORE and use it to replace the same folder of your previous version. 

4) (optional) If you didn't make any changes to the folder: Assets/SILVER AI System/ then it's actually recommended you copy/paste the entire
folder over, rather than just the /SILVER CORE/ folder. 

5) (optional) If the update includes new scenes / updated scenes, you may copy over the /DEMO SCENES/ folder as well, but it will replace changes you made to previous demo scenes.
